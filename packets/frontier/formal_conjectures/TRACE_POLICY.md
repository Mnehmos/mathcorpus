# Trace Policy — Formal Conjectures

All meaningful proof and import work for packets in this folder must go
through the tracked proof-search MCP loop, or be explicitly recorded in
`SOURCE_MAP.md` / `PROOF_ATTEMPTS.md` / `BLOCKERS.md` for
non-proof-search work (source review, statement-fidelity checks).

Private reasoning is not proof authority — only a Lean-verified result,
recorded through a tracked episode, counts as a proved packet.

## Global Operating Rule

Do not let proof work escape the proof environment. Per
`docs/proofsearch-integration.md`: evidence is tracked proof-search actions and Lean
kernel verdicts; a model's hidden reasoning, a prior transcript, a paper's claim, or a
proof checked some other way are **candidates**, not evidence, until the pinned Lean
kernel checks them inside a tracked episode.

- If it matters to how the proof was found, record it (attempts, diagnostics, pivots,
  Mathlib lookups, repairs) — the tracked episode trajectory does this automatically.
- If it proves the theorem, verify it through the Lean kernel inside a tracked episode.
- If it fails, keep it — failed/abandoned attempts become `negative_example` packets
  (`kind: negative_example`, `status: failed_attempt`, `trust.rung: 0`), not silently
  discarded reasoning.
- If it uses another domain's lemma/kit, record it in `CROSS_DOMAIN.md`.
- If it becomes reusable across domains, propose promotion — see
  `agents/CROSS_DOMAIN_PROMOTIONS.md`.

Private reasoning is not proof authority. The Lean kernel decides. The ledger records.
